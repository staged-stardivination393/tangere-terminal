# Installation methods

There are two installation methods: static and dynamic.

A palette could be installed **statically** by copying the RGB values for background,
foreground, and colors 0-15 into the configuration file for your terminal (assuming
there is such file). The configuration file for lxterminal, for example, called
`lxterminal.conf`, is traditionally located at `$HOME/.config/lxterminal/`.

A palette could also be installed **dynamically**. The idea is to use a
shell script, `setpal`, to load the tangere-terminal palette at the time of
terminal opening; `setpal` works by sending xterm control sequences, as defined
[here](https://www.xfree86.org/4.8.0/ctlseqs.html), to the terminal.  These control
sequences are well supported today, and dynamic installation has two advantages:

* it may work even on terminals (e.g., [sakura](https://github.com/dabisu/sakura))
with only limited forms of static palette customization.

* different versions of the palette (light vs. dark) may be loaded in different
terminal instances simply by running variants of the shell script.

Dynamic installation is the **recommended method**, so we start with it.

# Dynamic installation

The first step in dynamic installation is to download the provided [setpal](./setpal)
shell script, make it executable (`chmod +x setpal`), and copy it somewhere into your
`PATH`. You will be able to check that the `setpal` command works correctly by opening
your terminal and typing `setpal l` or `setpal d` to load the palette in its light or
dark version. The background color should change immediately, and typing:

```
msgcat --color=test | head -n 12
```

should show something like this:

![msgcat](./imgs/msgcat.png)

The last step in dynamical installation is to **automate the process of palette
loading**. Following xterm, many terminals accept an option (often flagged, `-e` or `-c`)
to execute a specific task when the terminal opens. Using sakura, here is an example of
`-e` usage that loads the dark palette on terminal opening:

```
sakura -e sh -c 'setpal d; exec bash'
```

In this example, everything after `-e` is the startup task to be executed when sakura
opens. The task consists of asking the standard shell, `sh`, to run the shell command in
single quotes after `-c`. This command in turns loads the dark version of the palette
(`setpal d`) before replacing the ongoing shell process with _bash_ (`exec bash`). As
a result, _bash_ will run in the new sakura instance until it closes.

Of course, you are free to replace `d` with `l` (if you prefer the light version of
the palette) and `bash` with your preferred interactive shell.

Finally, you may want to copy this one-liner example into a wrapper shell script to
avoid typing the example again and again.

## Note on command syntax

Some terminals require the totality of their startup command to be quoted. Using
[tilda](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda), for example:

```
tilda -c "sh -c 'setpal d; exec bash'"
```

Notice the inclusion of single quotes (for the shell) within double quotes (for
tilda).

## Note on tmux and screen

The `setpal` script will fail on tmux unless you include the following in
your tmux configuration file:

```
set-option -ga terminal-overrides "xterm-256color:Tc"
```

Currently, it seems that GNU screen does not suppport dynamic color setting. Hence,
users of GNU screen will need to install the tangere palette **statically**.

Static installation requires these RGB values to be inserted manually in your
**terminal configuration file**, at the correct place and in the correct format.

The included [palettes.txt](./palettes.txt) file may help you in this respect. This
is a plain-text file with formatted RGB values for:

* alacritty

* kitty

* lxterminal

* tilda

* xfce4-terminal

* Xresource (used by xterm and urxvt)
